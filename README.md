# Money-Mule-Account-Detection-Analysis

## 📋 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analytics investigation into money mule accounts within a banking portfolio. The project demonstrates a complete data science workflow from data ingestion and quality assessment to advanced pattern recognition and predictive modeling for financial crime detection.

### 🎯 Objective
Identify key predictors and behavioral patterns associated with money mule activities to enable proactive detection and prevention of financial crimes in banking operations.

## 📊 Project Highlights

- **Dataset Size**: 1,000+ customer accounts analyzed
- **Key Insights**: Demographic, behavioral, and financial risk indicators discovered
- **Business Impact**: Actionable recommendations for enhanced monitoring protocols


## 📈 Key Findings

### Primary Risk Indicators
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Increased withdrawal frequency, rapid fund turnover
- **Demographics**: Students (18-24 age group), renters, lower income brackets
- **Financial Profile**: Lower credit scores, minimal average balances
- **Digital Activity**: Higher social media usage and online shopping frequency

### Protective Factors
- Property ownership status
- Higher average account balances
- Regular deposit patterns
- Superior credit scores

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- **Account Data**: 1,000 records with 10 financial behavior variables
- **Account Holder Data**: 1,045 records with 13 demographic variables
- **Mule Flag Data**: 1,000 records with confirmed classifications

### Data Quality Improvements
- ✅ Resolved 5.2% missing values across datasets
- ✅ Removed 45 duplicate entries
- ✅ Standardized data types and formats

### Feature Engineering
- **Age Calculations**: Current age and age group categorizations
- **Financial Ratios**: Deposit-to-withdrawal and transfer-to-transaction ratios
- **Activity Metrics**: Transaction density
- **Income Segmentation**: Strategic income bracket classifications
